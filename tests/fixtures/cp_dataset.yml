        Master Species List","alias":"ICTV MSL","description":"The 7th lCTV Report
        formalized for the first time the concept of the virus species as the lowest
        taxon (group) in a branching hierarchy of viral taxa. As defined therein,
        “a virus species is a polythetic class of viruses that constitute a replicating
        lineage and occupy a particular ecological niche”. A “polythetic class” is
        one whose members have several properties in common, although they do not
        necessarily all share a single common defining property. In other words, the
        members of a virus species are defined collectively by a consensus group of
        properties. Virus species thus differ from the higher viral taxa, which are
        “universal” classes and as such are defined by properties that are necessary
        for membership.\n\nViruses are real physical entities produced by biological
        evolution and genetics, whereas virus species and higher taxa are abstract
        concepts produced by rational thought and logic. The virus/species relationship
        thus represents the front line of the interface between biology and logic.\nViruses
        (including virus isolates, strains, variants, types, sub-types, serotypes,
        etc.) should wherever possible be assigned as members of the appropriate virus
        species, although many viruses remain unassigned because they are inadequately
        characterized.\nAll virus species must be represented by at least one virus
        isolate.\nAlmost all virus species are members of recognized genera. A few
        species remain unassigned in their families although they have been clearly
        identified as new species.\nSome genera are members of recognized sub-families.\nAll
        sub-families and most genera are members of recognized families. Some genera
        are not yet assigned to a family; in the future they may either join an existing
        family or constitute a new family with other unassigned genera.\nSome families
        are members of the following recognized orders: Caudovirales, Nidovirales
        and Mononegavirales.\nThe hierarchy of recognized viral taxa is therefore:\n\n(Order),
        Family, (Sub-family), Genus, Species\n\nOnly the aforementioned taxa are recognized
        by the ICTV. Other groupings (from clade to super-family), may communicate
        useful descriptive information in some circumstances but they have no formally
        recognized taxonomic meaning. Similarly, the term “quasi-species”, although
        it captures an important concept, has no recognized taxonomic meaning.\nThe
        creation or elimination, (re)naming, and (re)assignment of a virus species,
        genus, (sub)family, or order are all taxonomic acts that require public scrutiny
        and debate, leading to formal approval by the full membership of the ICTV.
        In contrast, the naming of a virus isolate and its assignment to a pre-existing
        species are not considered taxonomic acts and therefore do not require formal
        ICTV approval. Instead they will typically be accomplished by publication
        of a paper describing the virus isolate in the peer-reviewed virology literature.","organisations":[{"name":"International
